In many cases, it is no longer possible to design feasible   algorithms that can freely access the entire data set. Instead of that we often   have to resort to techniques that allow for reducing the amount of data such as   sampling, sketching, dimensionality reduction, and core sets. Also explores   scenarios in which large data sets are distributed across several machines or   even geographical locations and the goal is to design efficient communication   protocols or MapReduce algorithms. Includes a final project and programming   assignments in which we explore the performance of our techniques when applied   to publicly available data sets.
